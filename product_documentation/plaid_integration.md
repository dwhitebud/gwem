# Plaid Integration Documentation

## Current Implementation

### Overview
The GWEM application has implemented initial Plaid integration to allow users to connect their financial accounts. This integration is currently in sandbox mode and supports basic account connection and data display.

### Implemented Features

#### 1. Configuration and Setup
- Plaid client configuration in `src/lib/plaid.ts`
- Environment variables setup for Plaid credentials
- Sandbox environment configuration

#### 2. API Endpoints
- `/api/plaid/link-token/route.ts`: Creates link tokens for initiating Plaid connection
- `/api/plaid/exchange-token/route.ts`: Exchanges public tokens for access tokens
- `/api/plaid/accounts/route.ts`: Fetches account data using access tokens

#### 3. React Components
- `PlaidLink.tsx`: Main component for initiating Plaid connection
  - Handles link token creation
  - Manages Plaid Link flow
  - Error handling and state management
- `ConnectedAccounts.tsx`: Displays connected account information
  - Account names and types
  - Current and available balances
  - Basic error handling and loading states

### Current Limitations
- Access tokens are stored in component state (not persistent)
- No user authentication integration
- Basic error handling
- No refresh functionality for account data
- Limited to sandbox environment

## Implementation Progress

### Completed Steps
1. Initial Plaid setup
   - Basic sandbox integration
   - Link token creation endpoint
   - Token exchange endpoint
   - Account data fetching

2. Database Schema Design
   - Created Prisma schema with the following models:
     - User: For user management
     - PlaidAccount: For storing Plaid integration details
     - Account: For individual account information
     - Transaction: For transaction history
   - Set up relationships between models
   - Added necessary fields for tracking sync status and errors

3. Environment Configuration
   - Created `.env.example` with required variables
   - Set up database connection string
   - Added Plaid API credentials configuration

### Pending Steps
1. Database Setup
   - [ ] Run initial database migration
   - [ ] Test database connections
   - [ ] Implement database seeding if needed

2. Service Layer Implementation
   - [ ] Create user management service
   - [ ] Implement Plaid account operations service
   - [ ] Add account data synchronization service
   - [ ] Build transaction history management service

3. Security Enhancements
   - [ ] Implement token encryption
   - [ ] Set up secure environment variable handling
   - [ ] Add authentication middleware

4. Testing
   - [ ] Unit tests for database operations
   - [ ] Integration tests for Plaid API interactions
   - [ ] End-to-end testing of the complete flow

### Current Blockers
- Database migration needs to be run with proper environment configuration
- Authentication system needs to be implemented before proceeding with user-specific features

### Next Immediate Steps
1. Complete database migration setup
2. Implement basic user authentication
3. Create service layer for database operations
4. Update existing components to use the database

## Pending Implementation

### 1. Data Persistence
- Set up a database schema for:
  - User accounts
  - Plaid access tokens
  - Account information
  - Transaction history
- Implement secure storage of access tokens
- Add data synchronization logic

### 2. Enhanced Features
- Transaction history display
- Account balance history
- Investment portfolio tracking
- Automated account refresh
- Real-time balance updates

### 3. Security Enhancements
- User authentication integration
- Secure token storage
- API route protection
- Error boundary implementation
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging

### 4. User Experience
- Success/error notifications
- Loading states and animations
- Account disconnection flow
- Manual refresh capability
- Account settings management

### 5. Production Readiness
- Move from sandbox to development/production environment
- Implement proper error monitoring
- Add analytics tracking
- Set up logging
- Create backup and recovery procedures

### 6. Testing
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end testing of Plaid flow
- Error scenario testing
- Performance testing

## Database Implementation

### Schema Overview
The following database schema has been implemented for Plaid integration:

#### User Model
- Stores basic user information
- Links to PlaidAccount through one-to-many relationship

#### PlaidAccount Model
- Stores Plaid integration details:
  - Access tokens (encrypted)
  - Institution information
  - Item IDs
  - Connection status
  - Last sync timestamp
- Links to User and Account models

#### Account Model
- Stores individual account information:
  - Account details (name, type, balances)
  - Currency information
  - Last sync timestamp
- Links to PlaidAccount and Transaction models

#### Transaction Model
- Stores transaction data:
  - Amount and date
  - Merchant information
  - Categories and transaction type
  - Currency information
- Links to Account model

### Next Steps

#### 1. Database Migration
- Run initial Prisma migration
- Set up database connection in production environment
- Implement database seeding (if needed)

#### 2. Service Layer Implementation
- Create services for:
  - User management
  - Plaid account operations
  - Account data synchronization
  - Transaction history management

#### 3. Security Implementation
- Implement token encryption
- Set up secure environment variable handling
- Add authentication middleware

## Next Steps Priority
1. Implement database integration for token storage
2. Add user authentication
3. Enhance error handling and notifications
4. Add transaction history display
5. Implement automated refresh functionality

## Testing Instructions
For sandbox testing:
- Use `user_good` / `pass_good` for basic account testing
- Use `user_custom` / `pass_custom` for custom account scenarios
- Any institution can be selected in sandbox mode

## Notes
- Current implementation is foundation only
- Production deployment will require additional security measures
- Consider implementing webhook support for real-time updates
- Monitor Plaid API usage and implement rate limiting
- Plan for error recovery and retry logic

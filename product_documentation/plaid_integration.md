# Plaid Integration Documentation

## Current Implementation

### Overview
The GWEM application has implemented initial Plaid integration to allow users to connect their financial accounts. This integration is currently in sandbox mode and supports basic account connection and data display.

### Implemented Features

#### 1. Configuration and Setup
- Plaid client configuration in `src/lib/plaid.ts`
- Environment variables setup for Plaid credentials
- Sandbox environment configuration

#### 2. API Endpoints
- `/api/plaid/link-token/route.ts`: Creates link tokens for initiating Plaid connection
- `/api/plaid/exchange-token/route.ts`: Exchanges public tokens for access tokens
- `/api/plaid/accounts/route.ts`: Fetches account data using access tokens

#### 3. React Components
- `PlaidLink.tsx`: Main component for initiating Plaid connection
  - Handles link token creation
  - Manages Plaid Link flow
  - Error handling and state management
- `ConnectedAccounts.tsx`: Displays connected account information
  - Account names and types
  - Current and available balances
  - Basic error handling and loading states

### Current Limitations
- Access tokens are stored in component state (not persistent)
- No user authentication integration
- Basic error handling
- No refresh functionality for account data
- Limited to sandbox environment

## Pending Implementation

### 1. Data Persistence
- Set up a database schema for:
  - User accounts
  - Plaid access tokens
  - Account information
  - Transaction history
- Implement secure storage of access tokens
- Add data synchronization logic

### 2. Enhanced Features
- Transaction history display
- Account balance history
- Investment portfolio tracking
- Automated account refresh
- Real-time balance updates

### 3. Security Enhancements
- User authentication integration
- Secure token storage
- API route protection
- Error boundary implementation
- Rate limiting
- Audit logging

### 4. User Experience
- Success/error notifications
- Loading states and animations
- Account disconnection flow
- Manual refresh capability
- Account settings management

### 5. Production Readiness
- Move from sandbox to development/production environment
- Implement proper error monitoring
- Add analytics tracking
- Set up logging
- Create backup and recovery procedures

### 6. Testing
- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end testing of Plaid flow
- Error scenario testing
- Performance testing

## Next Steps Priority
1. Implement database integration for token storage
2. Add user authentication
3. Enhance error handling and notifications
4. Add transaction history display
5. Implement automated refresh functionality

## Testing Instructions
For sandbox testing:
- Use `user_good` / `pass_good` for basic account testing
- Use `user_custom` / `pass_custom` for custom account scenarios
- Any institution can be selected in sandbox mode

## Notes
- Current implementation is foundation only
- Production deployment will require additional security measures
- Consider implementing webhook support for real-time updates
- Monitor Plaid API usage and implement rate limiting
- Plan for error recovery and retry logic
